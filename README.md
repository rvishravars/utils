## Probability Folder

This folder contains Python files related to probability calculations and utilities. Below is a brief explanation of each file:
- **bell_curve.py**: This file contains functions to calculate and plot bell curves (normal distributions).
- **cotinuous_covariance.py**: This file includes utilities for calculating continuous covariance.
- **descrete_covariance.py**: This file provides tools for calculating discrete covariance.
- **joint_probability_distribution.py**: This file contains functions to compute joint probability distributions.
- **summation_integration.py**: This file includes methods for performing summation and integration in probability calculations.

Each file is designed to help with different aspects of probability and statistics, making it easier to perform complex calculations and analyses.
